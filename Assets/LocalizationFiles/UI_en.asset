    m_Localized: 'On each turn, a player must first move his L-pawn, and may then
      move one of the neutral pawns. The game is won by leaving the opponent unable
      to move his L-piece to a new position.


      Pieces may not overlap or cover
      other pieces. When the L-piece is moved, it is picked up and placed on empty
      squares anywhere on the board. It can be turned or even flipped; the only rule
      is that it must end up in a different position from the one it started in -
      thus covering at least one square that it did not previously cover. To move
      a neutral piece, a player takes it and places it on an empty square anywhere
      on the board. '
